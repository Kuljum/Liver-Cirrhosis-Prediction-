# Liver Cirrhosis Prediction 🩺 (SmartBridge Internship Project)

This project was developed as part of the **AI/ML Virtual Internship** conducted by **SmartBridge** from May 19 – June 30, 2025.

## 🧠 Project Overview

Liver cirrhosis is a chronic and progressive liver disease often diagnosed at a late stage. This project uses **machine learning algorithms** to predict liver cirrhosis early based on clinical data — supporting timely diagnosis and treatment.

## 🛠️ Technologies Used
- Python (Jupyter Notebook)
- Scikit-learn, XGBoost
- Pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib, Seaborn
- SMOTE for class balancing

## 📊 ML Models Evaluated
- Logistic Regression
- K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN)
- Decision Tree
- Random Forest
- Naive Bayes
- XGBoost

> ✅ Best Performance: KNN with 86.32% Accuracy
